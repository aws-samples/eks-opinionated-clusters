# EKS Opinionated Clusters Workshop

Welcome to the repository of the [EKS Opinionated Clusters Workshop](https://eksopinionatedclustersworkshop.com)!

## Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving cloud landscape, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) has become a cornerstone for organizations deploying containerized applications. While EKS provides a robust foundation, the ecosystem of Independent Software Vendor (ISV) solutions can significantly enhance the Kubernetes experience, offering specialized tools and services that address specific needs and challenges.

This workshop is designed to showcase how ISV solutions can complement and extend the capabilities of Amazon EKS, helping platform engineers and application developers optimize containerized environments for performance, security, and cost-efficiency.

**If you are an ISV and would like your solution to be included in the workshop, please follow the [Contributing content](#contributing-content) guidelines.**
