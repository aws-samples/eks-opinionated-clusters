In computing systems, this is tracked through various metrics like processing time, memory usage, storage consumption, response times, and error rates. These measurements help determine how observable a system is. When we study and interpret this collected data, we\'re performing analysis.","sidebar":"observability"},"observability/ISV1/index":{"id":"observability/ISV1/index","title":"ISV 1","description":"Placeholder","sidebar":"observability"},"orchestration/index":{"id":"orchestration/index","title":"Orchestration","description":"This area focuses on the essential tools and technologies needed to operate and link Kubernetes applications effectively.
