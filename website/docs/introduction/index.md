Welcome to EKS Opinionated Clusters!

This hands-on workshop is designed to help you explore and understand how various Independent Software Vendor (ISV) solutions integrate with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Through guided exercises, you'll learn how to enhance your EKS clusters with industry-leading third-party tools and solutions.

You'll get practical experience working with popular ISV products that complement EKS in areas such as:

- **Orchestration**, featuring tools that manage the execution and connectivity of applications, spanning components that enable communication and tools that provide the automation and resilience capabilities essential for scaling applications effectively
- **Provisioning**, including essential tools and solutions that establish and strengthen the core infrastructure required for building Kubernetes-based applications
- **Observability**, describing the degree to which a system can be understood from its external outputs
- **Runtime**, including components required for container operations on Amazon EKS. This covers container runtime software that initiates container execution, solutions for managing persistent data storage, and tools that handle container networking and connectivity
- **Developer Experience**, grouping tools that enable engineers to build applications

By the end of this workshop, you'll have a solid understanding of how to leverage ISV solutions to extend your EKS capabilities and optimize your container workloads on AWS.

Let's begin exploring the rich ecosystem of ISV products that can help you get the most out of your Amazon EKS deployments!
