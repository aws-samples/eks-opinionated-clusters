Observability refers to how well we can understand a system's internal state by examining its external outputs. In computing systems, this is tracked through various metrics like processing time, memory usage, storage consumption, response times, and error rates. These measurements help determine how observable a system is. When we study and interpret this collected data, we're performing analysis.

To maintain continuous service availability, comprehensive monitoring and analysis of your application is essential. This means watching all components closely to quickly identify and fix any unusual behavior or issues. That's why observability is a critical cross-cutting concern - it spans across all system layers rather than being confined to just one layer. This explains why it's typically represented alongside the architecture rather than within a specific layer.
