The provisioning layer serves as the fundamental base of the cloud native ecosystem. This foundational layer contains essential tools that establish and strengthen the underlying infrastructure where applications operate. It includes automation tools for infrastructure setup, configuration, and management, along with specialized solutions for handling container images - from scanning and verification to secure storage.

Security is also a key component of this layer, featuring tools that help organizations implement and enforce security policies, manage access controls through authentication and authorization systems, and safely distribute sensitive information like passwords and encryption keys.
