This layer provides all the essential components required for containers to operate effectively in a cloud native setting. It includes three main elements: container runtimes (the software that launches and manages containers), storage solutions (tools that provide lasting data storage for containers), and networking tools (systems that handle container-to-container communications).

It's important to distinguish these functions from the storage and networking capabilities in the provisioning layer. While the provisioning layer focuses on setting up the broader platform infrastructure, the tools in this layer are specifically designed for day-to-day container operations - managing their lifecycle, handling their data storage needs, and facilitating their network communications.
